## Volunteer Work and Community Service
1. Eastside Baby Corner: Non profit organization that collects toys and clothing to give to children and families in need. I often packed clothes and sorted clothes. However, I also did a lot of organizing and odd jobs due to the fact that I came to volunteer often and got to know the managers of the location very well.
2. Seattle Humane Society: They house abandoned or stray pets and put them up for adoption as well as care for them. I made some blankets and toys for the dogs and cats at the shelter.
3. Northwest Harvest: They collect and package food to distribute to food banks around Washington State. I would package food into little bags and then place them in boxes.
4. Forgotten Childrens Fund: They collect toys and clothes to be gifted to families in need on christmas. I would read a childs profile that described there interests and then collect toys I thought they would like. I would then wrap those gifts and place them in a bag to be delivered on christmas.
